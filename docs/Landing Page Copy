## The problem

# Small HVAC businesses lose money silently

You know what you charged.

You don’t know what you actually spent on labour.

And that makes margin control impossible.

Most HVAC businesses with 3–15 techs are flying blind on their biggest cost: labour.

---

### 1. Untracked or mis-attributed hours

Techs forget to clock in.  
Managers enter generic shifts.  
Paper notes get cleaned up at payroll.

Those small gaps add up to thousands in hidden leakage every year.

If a tech works 20 minutes extra on three jobs per week and it isn’t attributed properly — you never see the true cost of those jobs.

---

### 2. Overtime that only shows up on payday

Emergency calls.  
Callbacks.  
Late finishes.

Overtime changes daily in HVAC. If your system doesn’t flag it in real time, you only discover it when payroll spikes.

By then, the margin is already gone.

---

### 3. Revenue per job… but no labour cost per job

You know what you invoiced.

But did that install actually make money?

Without job-level labour data, you can’t answer:

- Which installs are underpriced?
- Which service calls are bleeding margin?
- Which techs are consistently overrunning jobs?
- Whether your 45% gross margin is real — or just assumed

Every unassigned hour is a blind spot.

---

### 4. Payroll run without job context

Most small HVAC shops still:

- Copy times into spreadsheets  
- Export generic payroll reports  
- Manually reconcile QuickBooks  

Time data lives in one place.  
Payroll in another.  
Profitability nowhere.

Manual workflows are slow, error-prone, and impossible to scale.

---

# FieldCrew fixes the root cause

We don’t improve time tracking.

We enforce job-based payroll intelligence.

---

## How it works

### 1. Centralize  
**Job-coded time at the point of work**

No job.  
No clock-in.

Every hour is tied to a real install, service call, or maintenance job.

---

### 2. Enforce  
**Mandatory job selection — no generic shifts**

Workers must choose a job before clocking in.

No “8-hour day” entries.  
No clean-up at payroll.

The data is correct from the start.

---

### 3. Consolidate  
**Export payroll with job context**

Run payroll with:

- Worker  
- Hours  
- Job  
- Labour cost per job  

Export directly to QuickBooks-ready CSV.

Your payroll becomes job-aware.

---

# The only payroll that works when you work

Workers pick a job.  
They clock in.

You see:

- Labour hours per job  
- Labour cost per job  
- Margin pressure in real time  

Not just time.  
Money.

---

## Built for owners who care about margin

FieldCrew exists for one reason:

**Expose hidden labour cost.**

Success is when you rely on FieldCrew to understand labour cost per job and run payroll through it.

---

Catch leakage before payday.

---

# The difference

Most time tracking tools answer:

> “How many hours did my staff work?”

FieldCrew answers:

> “Which jobs are destroying my margins?”

That reframes the buying decision from admin to profitability.
