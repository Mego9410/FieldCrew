# Problem & ICP

## Core Problem

Small HVAC businesses lose money silently through:
- Untracked or mis-attributed hours
- Overtime leakage
- No visibility into labour cost per job
- Payroll run without job context

Owners often know revenue per job but **not labour cost per job**.

This makes margin control impossible.

## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

Primary ICP:
- US-based HVAC businesses
- 3–15 field technicians
- Owner-led
- Running payroll monthly or bi-weekly
- Already paying for software (QuickBooks, FSM tools)

Secondary ICP (later):
- Plumbing
- Electrical
- Cleaning services

We do NOT target:
- Solo trades
- Enterprise FSM customers
- White-collar teams
