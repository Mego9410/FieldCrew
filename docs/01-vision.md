# Vision

FieldCrew is not a time-tracking app.

FieldCrew is a **job-based payroll intelligence system** for small US HVAC crews.

Our goal is to:
- Expose hidden labour costs
- Prevent payroll leakage
- Show owners which jobs actually make money

We do this by forcing job-coded time at the point of work and carrying that context all the way through payroll and reporting.

We are building an operational dependency, not a nice UI.

Success is defined as:
- Owners relying on FieldCrew to understand labour cost per job
- Payroll being run through FieldCrew exports
- Weekly labour insight emails becoming habit

This is a vertical SaaS built for exit, not a lifestyle app.
