# Competitor Teardown

## Category: Time Tracking Tools

Common failures:
- Job selection optional
- Payroll exports worker-centric
- No surfaced labour cost per job
- No financial narrative

FieldCrew differs by:
- Enforcing job-coded time
- Making payroll job-aware
- Showing money, not hours

## Why Switching Happens

Competitors answer:
"How many hours did my staff work?"

FieldCrew answers:
"Which jobs are destroying my margins?"

That reframes the buying decision from admin to profitability.
