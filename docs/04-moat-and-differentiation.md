# Moat & Differentiation

## The Moat

FieldCrew owns the pipeline:

FIELD → JOB → PAYROLL → PROFIT

The moat is **job-based payroll intelligence**, not time tracking.

## Why This Is Defensible

- Jobs are mandatory (competitors allow generic time)
- Payroll exports include job context
- Labour cost per job is surfaced automatically
- Historical job data creates switching pain

Leaving FieldCrew means:
- Losing job-level labour history
- Re-training workers
- Rebuilding payroll workflows

## Soft Moats (Later)
- HVAC job templates
- Industry benchmarks
- Payroll setup concierge
