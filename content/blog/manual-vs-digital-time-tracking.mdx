title: Manual Timesheets vs Digital Time Tracking for HVAC Crews - What's Actually Costing You More?
description: Manual timesheets create errors, delay, and payroll leakage. See how digital job-coded time tracking saves time and improves job costing for HVAC.
excerpt: Paper and spreadsheet timesheets seem cheap—until you add the cost of errors, rework, and lost visibility into job cost. Here's the real comparison.

faq:
  - q: "Is digital time tracking worth it for small HVAC companies?"
    a: "Yes. The cost of manual errors, payroll leakage, and poor job costing usually outweighs the cost of a simple digital tool. Even 5–10 techs benefit from job-coded time and labour cost per job."
  - q: "What's the biggest downside of manual timesheets?"
    a: "Inaccurate and late data. Rounding, wrong job codes, and delayed entry mean you never see true labour cost per job and you can't fix payroll leakage or overtime in time."
  - q: "Can techs use digital time tracking from the field?"
    a: "Yes. Mobile-friendly and tablet-friendly time tracking lets techs clock in and out on the job from the van, so time is coded correctly when it happens instead of recreated later."

Manual timesheets feel low-cost: a piece of paper or a spreadsheet, then someone types it into payroll. The real cost is in **errors, rework, and lost visibility**. Once you add that up, digital job-coded time tracking often pays for itself in the first few months.

## What Manual Timesheets Cost You

- **Rounding and guesswork** — By the time someone fills out the sheet, they're approximating. That feeds wrong job cost and wrong estimates.
- **Delayed data** — You find out about overtime or overruns after the fact. You can't [reduce overtime costs](/blog/reduce-overtime-costs) or correct job creep in real time.
- **No labour cost per job** — Without time tied to jobs, you can't do real [job costing](/blog/hvac-job-costing-explained). You're left with company-wide labour and guesswork.
- **Admin rework** — Chasing missing codes, fixing wrong jobs, and reconciling with payroll eats hours every period.

Those costs are hard to see on a P&L, but they show up as lower margins and reactive management.

## What Digital Time Tracking Gives You

When techs log time to the job (or to travel, admin, etc.) as it happens:

- You get **labour cost per job** automatically, so you can see true margins and fix [jobs that take longer than estimated](/blog/jobs-take-longer-than-estimated).
- You see **overtime and overruns** as they develop, not after payroll closes.
- You have a **single source of truth** for payroll and job cost—no double entry, fewer errors.
- You can **export for payroll** without re-keying from paper.

The goal isn't more data for its own sake; it's **actionable** data: who worked what job, for how much cost, so you can correct course.

> **Field Tip:** If you're moving from manual to digital, make one rule non-negotiable—no time entry without a job (or non-billable code). That single rule forces the visibility that makes the rest of job costing and profit recovery possible.

## Making the Switch

Start with one pay period: require all time on the new system, job-coded. Compare labour cost per job to what you thought you had. Most contractors find enough leakage and clarity in the first month to justify the change. For HVAC crews of 5–20 techs, [FieldCrew](/#pricing) gives job-based time tracking and labour visibility without heavy IT.
