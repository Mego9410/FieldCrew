title: HVAC Job Costing Explained - Why Most Contractors Are Guessing Their True Margins
description: Most HVAC contractors don't know true labour cost per job. Learn how job costing works and why guessing margins hurts profit and estimating.
excerpt: Job costing is the only way to know if a job made or lost money. Most HVAC shops still guess—here's how to move from guesswork to real numbers.

faq:
  - q: "What is job costing in HVAC?"
    a: "Job costing is tracking all costs (labour, materials, equipment) for each job so you know the true cost and margin per job, not just company-wide revenue and expenses."
  - q: "Why do most HVAC contractors struggle with job costing?"
    a: "Without job-coded time tracking, labour is a company-wide number. You can't assign hours (and thus labour cost) to individual jobs, so you're left guessing which jobs are profitable."
  - q: "How do I get started with job costing?"
    a: "Start by requiring every labour hour to be coded to a job. Use time tracking that links to jobs and payroll so you get labour cost per job automatically. Then compare to revenue and estimate per job."

If you can't say how much labour went into each job, you're not really job costing—you're estimating margins from company-wide numbers. Real job costing ties **every labour dollar** to a specific job so you know true cost and margin per job.

## Why Company-Wide Numbers Aren't Enough

Revenue minus total labour tells you if the company made money. It doesn't tell you which jobs made money. A few bad jobs can hide inside a "good" overall margin. Until you see [labour spend per job in real time](/blog/labour-spend-per-job-real-time), you're guessing.

## The Role of Labour in Job Costing

Labour is usually the biggest variable cost on a job. Materials are often tracked by job; labour is not. So the missing piece is: **which hours (and thus which labour cost) belong to which job?** Once you have job-coded time:

- You get labour cost per job from actual hours × rates (including overtime where it applies).
- You can compare that to the job's revenue and to your estimate.
- You can see which job types and which crews are profitable.

That's job costing. Everything else is approximation.

## How Guessing Hurts You

When you guess margins, you underprice some work and overprice other work. You can't fix [jobs that take longer than estimated](/blog/jobs-take-longer-than-estimated) if you don't know which jobs ran over. You also can't spot [hidden payroll leakage](/blog/hidden-payroll-leak) that shows up as "missing" profit. Real numbers fix that.

> **Field Tip:** Run one month with strict job coding—every hour on a job or in a non-billable bucket. The first time you see labour cost by job, you'll spot at least a few jobs where the number is a surprise. That's the starting point for better estimating and pricing.

## What You Need to Job Cost Properly

1. **Time tied to jobs** — Techs log time to the job (or travel, admin, etc.). No unallocated hours.
2. **Rates and overtime** — So labour cost is hours × correct rate (regular vs overtime).
3. **Comparison to revenue and estimate** — Labour cost per job vs what you charged and what you quoted.

With that in place, you stop guessing and start managing. [FieldCrew](/#pricing) gives HVAC crews job-based time tracking and labour cost per job so you can see true margins and recover profit.
