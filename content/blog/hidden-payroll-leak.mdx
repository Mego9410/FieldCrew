title: The Hidden Payroll Leak Costing HVAC Companies 8–15% in Lost Profit
description: HVAC contractors lose 8-15% of profit to hidden payroll leakage. Learn what causes it and how to recover with job-coded time tracking.
excerpt: Most HVAC owners don't see where their labour dollars actually go. Hidden payroll leakage—unallocated time, rounding errors, and job creep—costs the average contractor 8–15% in lost profit every year.

faq:
  - q: "What is payroll leakage in HVAC?"
    a: "Payroll leakage is labour cost that doesn't map to billable work—unallocated time, rounding up on timesheets, admin time mixed with job time, and hours that slip into the wrong job codes. It shows up as lower margins even when revenue looks fine."
  - q: "How much do HVAC companies typically lose to payroll leakage?"
    a: "Industry benchmarks and field data suggest 8–15% of potential profit is common for contractors who rely on manual timesheets and loose job coding. The leak shrinks when every hour is assigned to a job and visible by cost."
  - q: "How can I fix payroll leakage without adding admin work?"
    a: "Use job-coded time tracking so techs log time to the job (or non-billable buckets) from the van. Review labour cost per job weekly and flag jobs where labour exceeds estimate. Tools like FieldCrew automate the link between time and job cost."

If your revenue is solid but margin still feels thin, the problem often isn't pricing—it's **where the labour hours went**. Most HVAC contractors pay for 40 hours per tech per week but only see a fraction of that time tied to specific jobs. The rest is payroll leakage: money going out the door without a clear link to revenue or recovery.

## What Counts as Payroll Leakage?

Payroll leakage is any labour cost that doesn't map cleanly to billable work or intentional non-billable categories. In practice it shows up as:

- **Unallocated time** — Hours on the timesheet that never get assigned to a job. They still get paid; they just don't show up in job costing.
- **Rounding and fudging** — "About 8 hours" or rounding up to the nearest half-hour. Small daily overstatements add up to a big number over a year.
- **Job creep** — Time that should be Job A gets logged to Job B (or to nothing). Your job reports are wrong and you can't see which jobs are actually profitable.
- **Admin and travel in the wrong bucket** — If travel and paperwork aren't coded separately, they inflate "job" hours and distort true job cost and estimate accuracy.

Once you start assigning every hour to a job (or to a clear non-billable code), you see real labour cost per job. That visibility is the first step to recovering the 8–15% that’s currently hidden.

## Why Manual Timesheets Make It Worse

Paper or spreadsheet timesheets encourage rounding and delay. By the time someone fills them out, they're guessing. Did that call take 45 minutes or an hour? Was the extra 20 minutes on the install job or drive time? Without a simple way to log time against the job as it happens, leakage grows. Digital time tracking that’s **job-coded from the start**—with techs clocking in and out on the job from the van—reduces guesswork and gives you data you can trust for job costing and [estimating](/blog/jobs-take-longer-than-estimated).

> **Field Tip:** One of the fastest wins is to require that no time entry is approved without a job (or non-billable code). Just that rule forces visibility and usually surfaces 5–10% of previously "invisible" labour in the first month.

## How to Start Closing the Leak

1. **Require job-coded time** — Every approved hour must be tied to a job or a defined non-billable category (travel, admin, training).
2. **Review labour cost per job weekly** — Compare actual labour to estimate. Jobs that consistently run over are a signal of leakage or poor estimating; [see labour spend per job in real time](/blog/labour-spend-per-job-real-time) to act before the month is over.
3. **Use a single source of truth** — One system for time, jobs, and payroll export keeps job cost and payroll in sync and makes it obvious when hours don't add up.

Recovering 8–15% doesn't require cutting pay or hours—it requires **seeing** where those hours go. With job-based time tracking and weekly labour cost reviews, most contractors can identify and correct the biggest leaks within a quarter.
