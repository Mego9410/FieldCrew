faq:
  - q: "How much does unplanned overtime cost HVAC contractors?"
    a: "Overtime premium (e.g. 1.5x) can add 20–30% to labour cost when it's unplanned and concentrated in a few workers. Visibility into who's approaching OT helps you schedule and reallocate before it locks in."
  - q: "Can I reduce overtime without cutting tech hours?"
    a: "Yes. By seeing hours and OT in real time, you can shift work to people under 40 hours, approve OT only when necessary, and fix payroll leakage so missing hours don't drive unnecessary OT."
  - q: "What's the first step to controlling overtime?"
    a: "Track time by job and by worker so you know who's at 35, 40, or 45 hours before pay week closes. Then you can rebalance jobs and schedules instead of discovering OT on the cheque."

Overtime itself isn't bad—sometimes the job needs it. **Unplanned** overtime and no visibility into who's approaching 40 hours are what blow the labour budget. You can reduce overtime cost without cutting hours by seeing it early and acting.

## Why Overtime Gets Out of Hand

- You don't see who's near 40 hours until payroll runs.
- Jobs run long and techs stay late; you find out after the fact.
- Some workers consistently hit OT while others have slack—no rebalancing.
- [Hidden payroll leakage](/blog/hidden-payroll-leak) and mis-coded time can make it look like you need more hours when you actually need better allocation.

Once you have job-coded time and weekly visibility into hours per worker, you can **reallocate and schedule** instead of just paying the OT.

## Control Levers That Don't Cut Hours

1. **See hours in real time** — Know who's at 35, 38, 42 hours before the week closes. Move the next call to someone under 40 where possible.
2. **Tie OT to the job** — When overtime is logged to the job, you see which jobs drive OT. That informs [estimating](/blog/jobs-take-longer-than-estimated) and pricing so OT is planned, not accidental.
3. **Reduce leakage** — Unallocated time and wrong job codes can make it look like you're short on hours. Fix the leak and you often need less OT for the same work.
4. **Approve OT deliberately** — Make OT the exception: require a reason and, where possible, assign the work to someone under 40 first.

> **Field Tip:** Run a simple report each week: hours per worker, with a flag for anyone over 36. Use it to balance the next week's schedule. Most contractors cut unplanned OT by 20–30% in the first quarter just with that visibility.

## The Role of Job-Coded Time

When every hour is coded to a job (or to non-billable), you see both **who** is in OT and **which job** is consuming it. That lets you fix overruns and [labour spend per job](/blog/labour-spend-per-job-real-time) instead of just paying the premium. [FieldCrew](/#pricing) gives you job-based time and labour cost so you can control overtime without cutting hours.
