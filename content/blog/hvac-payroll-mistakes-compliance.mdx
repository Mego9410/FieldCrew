faq:
  - q: "What payroll mistakes create the most risk for HVAC contractors?"
    a: "Inaccurate or incomplete time records (e.g. rounding that always benefits the employer), failing to pay overtime correctly, and not keeping records of hours by job or by workweek. Clear, job-coded time records help defend pay practices."
  - q: "Does job-coded time tracking help with compliance?"
    a: "Yes. When every hour is recorded against a job or a non-billable code, you have a clear audit trail. Combined with correct OT calculation and reducing overtime through visibility, you're in a stronger position."
  - q: "How can I reduce compliance risk without a big payroll system?"
    a: "Use time tracking that records actual start/stop (or duration) and ties to job. Export to payroll so pay is based on the same data. Avoid rounding that systematically short-changes workers and keep records for at least two years."

Payroll mistakes in HVAC don't just cause rework—they can create **wage and hour exposure**. Rounding errors, missing records, and incorrect overtime are common triggers. Here's how to avoid them and how job-coded time helps.

## High-Risk Payroll Mistakes

- **Rounding that always benefits the employer** — Systematic rounding down or to the nearest 30 minutes can underpay workers. If you round, use a neutral rule and document it.
- **No record of actual hours** — Paper timesheets that get "adjusted" or lost make it hard to prove you paid for all time worked. Digital, job-coded records give you an audit trail.
- **Overtime miscalculation** — OT must be calculated by workweek, not by job or pay period. Without [visibility into hours per worker](/blog/reduce-overtime-costs), you can miss OT or pay it wrong.
- **Unallocated time** — When hours aren't tied to a job, you don't know what was paid for what. That can obscure [payroll leakage](/blog/hidden-payroll-leak) and complicate disputes.

## How Job-Coded Time Reduces Risk

When time is recorded against the job (or a non-billable code) as it happens:

- You have **actual hours** by worker and by period—no guesswork at pay week.
- You can **calculate OT correctly** by workweek and pay the premium where due.
- You have **records** that show what work was done and when, which supports both payroll and [job costing](/blog/hvac-job-costing-explained).

Compliance isn't just "pay the right amount"—it's **being able to show** you did. Good time tracking is the foundation.

> **Field Tip:** Audit one pay period: compare time records to pay. If there are adjustments (rounding, "forgotten" hours), document the rule and make sure it's applied consistently. If you can't explain the difference, fix the process before it becomes a problem.

## Simple Steps to Stay Clear

1. **Record actual time** — No systematic rounding that underpay workers.
2. **Calculate OT by workweek** — Use job-coded time to see who hit 40+ and pay 1.5x on the excess.
3. **Keep records** — Retain time and pay records for at least two years. Export from your [time tracking](/blog/manual-vs-digital-time-tracking) so payroll and records match.

[FieldCrew](/#pricing) gives you job-based time and labour cost so you have clear records and correct labour data for payroll and compliance.
