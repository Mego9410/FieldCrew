title: From Guesswork to Control - How HVAC Owners Can See Labour Spend Per Job in Real Time
description: Stop guessing labour cost. See labour spend per job in real time with job-coded time tracking and take control of margins and overtime.
excerpt: When labour cost is visible by job as the week unfolds, you can fix overruns and overtime before they lock in. Here's how to get there.

faq:
  - q: "What does labour spend per job in real time mean?"
    a: "It means you can see, as the week or month progresses, how much labour cost has been logged to each job (hours and rate, including OT). So you can compare to estimate and to budget before the period closes."
  - q: "Why is real-time labour visibility important?"
    a: "So you can act: reallocate labour, approve or limit OT, and fix overruns before the month is over. After-the-fact reports are too late to change behaviour."
  - q: "How do I get labour spend per job?"
    a: "Use job-coded time tracking so every hour is assigned to a job (or non-billable). Your system multiplies hours by rate (and OT premium) and rolls it up by job. Tools like FieldCrew do this for HVAC crews."

Seeing labour spend per job **after** the month closes is useful for history. Seeing it **as the week unfolds** is what gives you control. You can fix overruns, [reduce overtime](/blog/reduce-overtime-costs), and correct job creep before they're baked into the pay run.

## Why "Real Time" Matters

When labour cost is visible by job in real time:

- You see which jobs are **over estimate** while there's still time to adjust scope or resource.
- You see which workers are **approaching 40 hours** so you can rebalance instead of paying unplanned OT.
- You spot **mis-coded time** (e.g. admin on a job code) and fix it before it distorts [job costing](/blog/hvac-job-costing-explained) and payroll.

After-the-fact reports tell you what happened. Real-time visibility lets you change what happens next.

## What You Need to Get There

1. **Job-coded time** — Every hour logged to a job or a defined non-billable code. No "misc" or unallocated time.
2. **Rates and OT** — So labour cost = hours × correct rate (including 1.5x where applicable).
3. **Roll-up by job** — A view (or export) that shows labour cost per job, updated as time is entered.

With that, "labour spend per job" is no longer a spreadsheet exercise—it's a live view you can use to manage the week.

> **Field Tip:** Start with a single view: labour cost per job for the current week (or month to date). Review it once or twice a week. The first time you see a job blowing past its estimate before the period ends, you'll know why real-time visibility pays off.

## From Guesswork to Control

Most HVAC contractors move from "we think we're okay on labour" to "we know exactly what each job cost" when they adopt job-coded time and labour-by-job visibility. That shift is what closes [hidden payroll leakage](/blog/hidden-payroll-leak) and turns labour from a black box into a lever. [FieldCrew](/#pricing) is built for that: job-based time tracking and labour cost per job so you can see and act in real time.
