title: The Real Reason Small HVAC Companies Struggle With Profit — It's Not Revenue
description: "Many small HVAC contractors have decent revenue but thin profit. The cause is often labour visibility—not pricing. Here's how to fix it."
excerpt: "Revenue can look fine while profit stays thin. The real issue is usually labour—where it went, how it was coded, and whether you see cost per job."

faq:
  - q: "Why do small HVAC companies have thin profit despite good revenue?"
    a: "Often labour cost is under control on paper but not visible by job. Without job costing and labour per job, you can't see which jobs or behaviours are eroding margin—so you can't fix them."
  - q: "Is the solution to raise prices?"
    a: "Sometimes, but often the first step is to see where labour is going. Payroll leakage, overtime, and jobs that run over estimate can be fixed before you touch pricing. Then you know your true cost before you set price."
  - q: "What's the fastest way to improve profit without adding revenue?"
    a: "Get labour cost per job. Require job-coded time, review labour vs estimate weekly, and fix overruns and leakage. Many contractors recover 8–15% of missing profit in the first year with that visibility."

Small HVAC companies often have enough revenue but still struggle with profit. The usual suspect isn't price—it's **not seeing where labour dollars go**. Until you see labour cost per job, you're managing in the dark.

## Revenue Isn't the Only Variable

Raising prices can help, but if you don't know true cost per job, you might be undercharging some and overcharging others. Worse, you might be losing 8–15% to [hidden payroll leakage](/blog/hidden-payroll-leak) and not know it. Profit improvement starts with **labour visibility**, then pricing and process.

## What "Labour Visibility" Means

- **Every hour has a home** — Job-coded time (or clear non-billable codes). No unallocated hours.
- **Labour cost per job** — You see actual cost vs revenue and vs estimate for each job.
- **Overtime and overruns in view** — You can [reduce overtime costs](/blog/reduce-overtime-costs) and fix [jobs that take longer than estimated](/blog/jobs-take-longer-than-estimated) because you see the data in time.

Without that, profit leaks away and you don't know which jobs or behaviours to fix first.

## The Order of Operations

1. **Get job-coded time** — So labour cost per job is real, not estimated.
2. **Review labour vs estimate** — Find overruns and leakage; fix process and coding.
3. **Then** refine pricing and sales so you're pricing from true cost.

> **Field Tip:** Run one month with strict job coding and no "misc" bucket. The first labour-by-job report will show at least a few surprises—jobs that cost more than you thought, or hours that were never assigned. That's your profit-recovery roadmap.

Small HVAC doesn't need more complexity—it needs **one source of truth** for time and job cost. With [FieldCrew](/#pricing), crews get job-based time tracking and you get labour cost per job so profit stops being a guess.
