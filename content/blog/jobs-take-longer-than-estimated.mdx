title: Why Your HVAC Jobs Take Longer Than Estimated (And How to Fix It)
description: HVAC jobs often run over estimate. Learn why—poor data, job creep, scope—and how job-coded time and labour visibility fix estimating accuracy.
excerpt: Jobs running over estimate kill margin. The fix isn't just "estimate better"—it's seeing actual labour per job and closing the loop between estimate and reality.

faq:
  - q: "Why do HVAC jobs often run over estimate?"
    a: "Common causes: estimates based on guesswork (no historical labour per job), scope creep, travel and admin mixed into job time, and no feedback loop from actual labour cost back into the next estimate."
  - q: "How can I improve estimate accuracy?"
    a: "Use actual labour cost per job from job-coded time tracking. Compare estimated vs actual hours and cost by job type, then adjust future estimates. Review job costing and overruns weekly."
  - q: "What's the first step to fixing overruns?"
    a: "Get labour cost per job for the last 2–3 months. Flag jobs that ran over. Use that list to tighten estimates and to spot payroll leakage or mis-coded time."

When jobs consistently run over estimate, margin disappears. The fix isn't just "add more hours to the quote"—it's **seeing actual labour per job** and using that to improve estimates and spot leakage.

## Why Estimates Miss

- **No historical data** — If you've never had [labour cost per job](/blog/labour-spend-per-job-real-time), your estimates are guesswork. You don't know how long "that type of job" really took last time.
- **Scope creep** — Extra work gets done but not quoted. Without time tied to the job, you can't see which jobs blew up and why.
- **Travel and admin in "job" time** — When uncoded time lands in the job bucket, job hours look higher than they should. Your estimates get inflated to cover cost that could be tracked separately.
- **No feedback loop** — Estimated hours and actual hours never get compared by job type, so the next estimate is no better.

## How to Close the Loop

1. **Track actual labour per job** — Job-coded time gives you hours and cost per job. No more company-wide averages.
2. **Compare to estimate** — For each job (or job type), compare estimated vs actual hours and cost. Flag overruns and under-runs.
3. **Adjust the next quote** — Use overrun data to tighten estimates and to push back on scope. Use under-runs to avoid leaving money on the table.
4. **Separate travel and admin** — Code them so job hours reflect true job work. [Time tracking](/blog/manual-vs-digital-time-tracking) that supports job and non-billable codes makes this possible.

> **Field Tip:** Pick one job type (e.g. standard install) and run the numbers: average actual hours and cost over the last 10–20 jobs. If that number is higher than your current estimate, you're losing margin every time. Update the estimate and track the next 10 to confirm.

## When Overruns Are a Data Problem

Sometimes "overruns" are really **mis-coded time** or [payroll leakage](/blog/hidden-payroll-leak)—hours that shouldn't be on the job. Once every hour is coded to a job or a non-billable bucket, you see true job labour. Then you can fix both the estimate and the process. [FieldCrew](/#pricing) gives you labour per job and estimate-accuracy visibility so you can stop guessing and start improving.
